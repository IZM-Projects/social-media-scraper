# Social Media Links Scraper

This project scrapes social media URLs from any given URLs and saves them as images or Excel files (optional).

### Requirements

You will need [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) installed on your system to run this project.

### Running

Simply add your links to `links.txt` file and run the following command:

```bash
deno task generate
```

This will check every page that is listed in your text file and will save the results in the output folder; you can change the folder name from `src/config.json`.

Additionally you can run the `convert-xlsx` or `generate-images` tasks to create images and Excel files from the results.
